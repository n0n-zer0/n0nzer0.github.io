# Approach

1. Blackbox review
2. Whitebox review
3. Attack plan
   1. implement
   2. execute
   3. refine,reasess,debug
   4.  adapt or repeat ?

My appraoch to a white box Web application penetration test always starts with a **blackbox** portion. This might seem counterintuitive but I have found that looking at the functioning application gives the best impression of the intented goals and features of the application.

After the **blackbox** review you should have:

* A list/overview of the exposed features and endpoints for the available roles/users
* A rough idea of the Authentication and Session mechanism
* A rough idea of the languages and frameworks used 
*
