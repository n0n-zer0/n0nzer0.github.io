### Blackbox review

My approach to a white box Web application penetration test always starts with a **blackbox** portion. This might seem counter-intuitive but I have found that looking at the functioning application gives the best impression of the intended goals and features of the application.

After the **blackbox** review you should have:

* A list/overview of the exposed features and endpoints for the available roles/users
* Maybe some vulnerabilities or vulnerable endpoints
* A rough idea of the Authentication and Session mechanism
* A rough idea of the languages and frameworks used 
* a rough idea of functionality/features that might be valuable
* a rough idea of functionality/features that might be vulnerable
